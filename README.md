#AI- Integrated Hospital-Management-System


Key Features and Modules:

*User Administration
    The system supports role-based login for physicians, patients, and administrators. It includes patient profile management features such as personal information, medical records, and user preferences. Doctor profiles include details like specialty, availability, and patient ratings.

*Scheduling of Appointments
    An interactive calendar UI allows physicians to manage their availability. Patients can book, cancel, or reschedule appointments. Physicians receive reminders when there are new appointment requests.

*Medical Record Handling
    The system enables uploading and viewing of lab reports, prescriptions, and treatment notes. Physicians can edit and comment on patient records. Patients have secure, 24/7 access to their medical history at any time.

*Chatbot Integration
    The system includes a health-centric, smart chatbot integrated into the main dashboard. Developed using Dialogflow, this chatbot provides 24/7 real-time customer support, answering questions related to symptoms, treatments, and clinic service FAQs. It also offers post-treatment guidance and lifestyle counseling. The chatbot is capable of sending automated appointment and medication reminders. For initial triage, it can direct patients to emergency services when symptoms are severe. The chatbot utilizes natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to continuously improve its response quality over time.

*Emergency Assistance
    A single-tap emergency call button is available to quickly summon on-duty doctors or emergency contacts. When activated, it can also send the patient's location (if configured) and medical history to ensure immediate and informed response.

*Notifications and Reminders
    The system sends notifications via email and SMS to remind patients of their medication schedule. These reminders are fully user-configurable to suit individual needs.
